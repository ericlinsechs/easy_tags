Easy Tags is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to simplify the management of Finder tags on macOS. With Easy Tags, users can effortlessly add, remove, and create new tags for files, enhancing the organization and accessibility of their data.

This project was developed as my final project for [Harvard's CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/project/).

- **Tag Creation:** Users can create new tags on-the-fly by entering tag names in the input box.
